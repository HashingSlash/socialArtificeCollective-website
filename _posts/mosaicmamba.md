Each of these circles will change the colour of your Mumba. This will even have an impact on the light trail you leave behind. Who knows what your game screen will look like when your round of Mosaic Mumba is over? It could be a unique game screen that no one else has ever ended up with. The possibilities are endless.

Choose direction: Arrow Keys.

Play game: P.

Reset game: R.

Exit game: Esc.

Dificulty can be adjusted with keys; 1, 2, 3.

They adjust the brightness of the trail left behind by your Mumba. Reset the game screen (R key) for best result.
