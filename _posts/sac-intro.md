Welcome to a single ‘repository’ for the works of different forms. This is a shared spaced for various creators of endemic origin. Bound together by a common desire to contribute something to the world. The Social Artifice Collective (or SAC) are a group who wish to create while not bound by medium or genre.   

 
##  The Cap:
# Owner of Social Artifice Collective.
Hands off owner who wants SAC to find itself and develop its own voice.

# Team Manager
A project manager who runs the Social Artifice Collective for The Cap. After working 20 years in construction, they pivoted into the online space. After 3 years in the “internet business” running small teams into early retirement, they were contacted by The Cap to manage a small team under the name “The Social Artifice Collective”.

# Site Admin, Code
Eccentric catboi-techbro with “101 skill”. Traded their previous projects to The Cap for a lifetime supply of red New York Yankee baseball caps. Thought it was a great deal at the time, as the website is a barely modified blog template. Has worked with Dee, Blu, and Hardli at local game jams under the group name Cork Shak Prod.


## Dee Satyr Wrist:

# Satire Articles
A Satyr who seems to have found its home talking shit in a digital realm. Has dreams of joining the self-help speaking circuit quoting heavy metal lyrics. A satirist, insane, or constantly relocating on the scale between the two. They have written for CSP previously, notably the web article for Asphalt Amphibian, and most content for Everychimp. 


##  Blu Jones:

# Personal Blogs
A character who attempts to write with some level of wise introspection, but mostly makes you worry about their mental health. Does visual art for the collective; including Cork Shak Prod video game sprites.
