Below is an example of an animation the NFT displayed to promote the second Blokassette collection.

This allows me (and anyone else using mutable NFTs this way) to promote work to a supporters. It also allows supporters the ability to opt in and out of the advertisements. All they need to do is send the asset back to the creator to no longer see in amongst their collection.
