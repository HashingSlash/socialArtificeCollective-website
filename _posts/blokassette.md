title: "Blokassette"
excerpt: "4 series of music loops all derived from a shared musical score. You know those NFT images of a character and a entire collection is made from that character wearing different clothing? Its like that but one musical score is being metaphorically played by different people on different instruments. Unique, but not exactly easy to explain."

Blokassette is a collection of music loops generated from a simple score. Each loop is a unique combination of different instruments playing that score. Each loop has a image thumbnail that has been generated using visualization of the audio loop. Some thumbnails have then been passed through AI to make the image more interesting, but this was abandoned. These files have been uploaded to IPFS and the metadata logged with NFT's. The attribute data has been used to log what instruments are in that loop, as well as attributing the performance to a metaphorical session musician. Ultimately the goal was to demonstrate a 'musician-first' approach to audio NFT collections, while expanding on the Proof of Concept in Nifty Loops. 


## 4 series, 1 collection
Series utilize different visualisation methods for the thumbnail image, allowing for easy identification. Each progressing series introduces more hypothetical performers to the collection.


## 'Hand made' assets

While the music is systematically 'generated', all media files are manually exported and minted with custom scripts to facilitate dual-media assets.


## Traits as 'performer credits'

Part of the intention behind the Blokassette series is to use of NFT 'traits' to track different  hypothetical performers within the series.
