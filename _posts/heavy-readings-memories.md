## Every Time I Die - Fear and Trembling 

"Though it may haunt us and break our hearts // 
Death cannot tear us apart" 

Death Is not to be feared. One of the scary things about death is the absence left in wake. Even though you can no longer make new memories with someone who you have lost, you can still access all your old ones. They will always be “with you”

## The Safety Fire - Beware the Leopard (Jagwar) 

"They died twice // 
When the breath left their bodies // 
And their name was said // 
For the last time." 

The death of your body is not the death of you. Most people will have a concept of you in their minds that they refer to when you are not around. One of the painful things about death is this concept is solidified. I can no longer grow or change on its own. It can, however, still be accessed and updated buy discussing the lost with those who remain. The second death referred to in these lyrics can be interpreted as this. When no one continues to speak your name. 

Think to famous musicians that are no longer alive. Even though they can no longer contribute to the socially held concept of themselves, those who remain are constantly adding/taking from their legacy. In a way this continues their presence. Consider David Bowie for example. Now that he has passed, he will no longer be able to create new material. His work remains in his wake and continues to influence and inspire people. So, despite his absence, the presence is still here with us all. And that won't change until his music stops being played, and people stop talking about him. Only then is he truly lost to time.

## After the Burial - Encased in Ice 

"We are nothing more than memories" 

This speaks to how we conceptualise each other. You can think of people when they are not around. When a loved one is on holiday for example. You can remember what they are like, how they act, what they enjoy, and find ways to bring them your mind. Things that smell like them, music they enjoy. Engaging sences in relation to this individual. Prescence in the face of absence.

## Alpha Wolf - Devon St 

"If i can learn from this, then i will teach you this // 
Take all the time to reminisce"

If what remains of someone when they are lost is to be seen as still having a strong presence, you must engage in remembering them. Individually, and collectively. Take your time to strengthen those memories. They are what you have in the wake of a passing.
