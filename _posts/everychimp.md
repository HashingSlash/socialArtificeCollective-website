Everychimp tells the tale of a journey through the jungle, and the animals one might meet along the way. Jump up and down trees for increased motion and hidden fruits. You can jump onto the heads of enemies to defeat them, but most can be bypassed if the player chooses. 

There are no lives in this game. Points are deduced each time the player character is defeated by other animals in the jungle. Towards the end of the game the player will be presented with some choices that may not be overly obvious. While talking to either crow initiates different endings, the player also has the option to leave the conflict and not be involved. There also may be some padlocks visible in some final moments. They can be interacted with if the player chooses, but again, it's not exactly obvious. 

This game is intended to be about the pitfalls of ill intended guidance, and where that might lead the uninitiated. I wanted to use animals capable of tool use (Macaque chimps, Crows) and to differentiate one crow from others using albino-ism. In hindsight this symbolism might not covey the correct intent behind the message, but it is presented “as-is”.
