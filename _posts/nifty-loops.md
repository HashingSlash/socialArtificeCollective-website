title: "Nifty Loops"
excerpt: "Nifty Loops is a series of short music loops, procedurally assembled following some basic musical rules. NFT's have been used as a form of metadata, while IPFS has been used to host the files. Visual artists use NFTs to track the contents of images, and we have similarly attempted to track the differences in the audio loops using the same format. "

All loops in the Nifty Loops Collection are built around the same musical patterns (scores/tablature). There is 1 Drum Pattern, 1 Bass Pattern, and 2 other musical patterns. Each of these 4 patterns can be played by 2 different instruments. The 13 ‘loops’ are different results from this ruleset. The instruments that are playing in each loop are noted in the NFT traits. I believe this is what makes Nifty Loops a novel offering. I am yet to have seen a music/audio NFT collection using traits as credits/liner notes/attributions like this. Each Loop NFT in this collection is minted with a quantity of 10.

##  Full Piece: (NIFTY1F)
A 10-minute-long piece comprised of a progression through all 13 loops. This is minted with a quantity of 1 and is more of a traditional 'track' release. You can listen to the piece here to hear the range available within Nifty Loops.

##  Cover: (NIFTY1C)
Cover art has also been minted for Nifty Loops. This allows for the collection to be represented on platforms that don’t currently support audioNFTs. The covers were minted with a quantity of 1000. The intention is also to have a low barrier of entry into supporting Nifty Loops that should work on most platforms.
