excerpt: "This article examines the similarities between various decision-making systems, including those of individuals, artificial intelligence, and the economy. Authored with the assistance of AI, the selection of service providers was prioritised based on market capitalisation. Consequently, Microsoft's Copilot was utilised to define terms, revise the draft, and generate the cover image."

## What it is like to choose
In the realm of decision-making, the decision matrix is a pivotal tool that enables individuals and organizations to navigate complex choices with clarity and precision. By systematically evaluating and prioritizing options based on predefined criteria, decision matrices facilitate informed and rational decision-making processes. This document explores the diverse applications of decision matrices, drawing parallels between artificial intelligence and human activities such as shopping. It examines how decision-making units in AI resemble the choices made by shoppers and how these decisions collectively shape outcomes in both domains.

A decision matrix is a structured tool used to evaluate and prioritize various options based on predefined criteria, enabling more informed and rational decision-making. By assigning weights to different factors and scoring each alternative against these criteria, the matrix provides a clear comparison, facilitating clarity in complex scenarios. Whether navigating the aisles of a supermarket, determining product inventories in a business, or programming artificial intelligence, the decision matrix transforms subjective choices into quantifiable outcomes, offering insights into the interplay of preferences, constraints, and objectives.

Decision-making units in AI are comparable to people shopping. They put together selections that meet the desired output based on requirements, similar to AI generating sentences or other media. Each choice involves words, colors, sounds, or at least the information required for these to be emulated with equipment like screens and speakers, received by sensors, parsed, and received by its communication partner.

In a similar experience at the shops, while browsing through the aisle looking for lunch bars, one may encounter a wide range of choices—potentially 40-50 different products. Factors to be considered include budget, discounts, price breaks, quantity needed, variety, health options, and other personal preferences. Choices can be influenced by stock availability, dietary restrictions (health, ethical, religious), price limitations, and accepted payment methods.

From a materialist perspective, consciousness is often viewed as an emergent property of physical processes rooted in the brain's neural networks. This viewpoint holds that mental states, experiences, and self-awareness arise from biochemical and electrical activity organizing sensory data and prior knowledge into coherent thoughts and perceptions. Decision matrices translate inputs into quantifiable outcomes, similar to the brain’s processing mechanisms.

Just as shoppers' decisions influence store inventory, businesses use decision matrices to make decisions regarding stock levels and product offerings. Decisions at one level impact the next, ultimately affecting departmental or corporate options. Businesses must comply with their owners' legal duties and constraints, adding weights to their decision-making matrices.

This raises the question: if human consciousness emerges from complex decision matrices and economic systems emerge from business and shopper decisions, can AI, which also relies on complex decision matrices, be considered equally conscious?

This created along side the largest available AI by market capitalisation, which is Copilot.
